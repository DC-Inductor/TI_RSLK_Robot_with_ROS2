# Final Project - Integrating a TI-RSLK Robot with ROS2


This project focused on implementing the robotic operating system ROS2 to control the behavior of a TI-RSLK robot. This robot needed to be able to be controlled and driven by the user, react to bumper aggregations, enter a dance mode, enter a rouge mode (upon a set number of bumper aggregations), and be rescued from the rogue mode by the user. This project integrates 4 separate machines: An Arduino Mega 2560, PC/Desktop, Raspberry Pi 5, and Tiva C Launch Pad microcontroller. By integrating these 4 systems over both Wi-Fi (ROS2), and serial communications (ASCII Drivers), it became clear how the different communication and integration methods all play a key role in design and implementation of Hardware/Software projects.
